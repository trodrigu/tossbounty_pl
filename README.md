# Tossbounty Program Library
This is a library for the Tossbounty program. It is a program that allows you to create a bounty for a task and reward the person who completes it. Upon bounty claim the program can fire off a pause to the integrated protocol in order to prevent further hacks.  Since arbitrary CPI is considered a security risk, we create a new program per organization which uses an Anchor attribute to validate the program ID.
